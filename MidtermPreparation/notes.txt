Histograms are a good way to understand how values or a variable are distributed, and which sorts of data preparation may be needed to make the variable more useful in a model. 
For example, for a categorical variable that has too many distinct values to be informative in a model, the histogram would help them decide how to consolidate those values.

The Data Understanding stage encompasses sorting the data.

exploratory data analysis(EDA)
- summarize main Characteristics of the data
- gain better understanding of the data set
- uncover relationships between variables
- extract important variables

What is correlation?
Measures to what extentent different variables are interdependent
correlation doesn't imply causation

pearson correlation
measure the strength of the correlation between two features. strong correlation : p values less than 0.001 and correlation coefficient close to 1 or -1

analysis of Variance(ANOVA) in w4 -> f-test
- finding correlation between different groups of a categorical variables

Why regression?
Regression analysis consists of a set of machine learning methods that allow us to predict a continuous outcome variable (y) based on the value of one or multiple predictor variables (x).
Briefly, the goal of regression model is to build a mathematical equation that defines y as a function of the x variables. 
Next, this equation can be used to predict the outcome (y) on the basis of new values of the predictor variables (x).

big data :
The term “big data” refers to data that is so large, fast or complex that it’s difficult or impossible to process using traditional methods. 
The act of accessing and storing large amounts of information for analytics has been around a long time

Why Is Big Data Important?
The importance of big data doesn’t revolve around how much data you have, but what you do with it. You can take data from any source and analyze it to find answers that enable 
1) cost reductions, 2) time reductions, 
3) new product development and optimized offerings, and 4) smart decision making. When you combine big data with high-powered analytics, you can accomplish business-related tasks such as:
    Determining root causes of failures, issues and defects in near-real time.
    Generating coupons at the point of sale based on the customer’s buying habits.
    Recalculating entire risk portfolios in minutes.
    Detecting fraudulent behavior before it affects your organization.
